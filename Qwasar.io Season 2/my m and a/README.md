# Welcome to My M And A

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?


## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
- Merge the CSV files: The first step is to load the three CSV files, merge them, and ensure they match the schema of your existing database.
- Convert the merged data into SQL: After merging, save the merged data into an SQL file.
- Avoid storing the CSV files: Make sure the CSV files are deleted or not stored in your repository to meet the project requirements.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
- Define the my_m_and_a function:
- Load the CSV data into pandas DataFrames.
- Ensure the data conforms to the required schema.
- Concatenate the DataFrames.
- Return the merged DataFrame.
- Save the merged data to SQL:
- Use your existing my_ds_babel.csv_to_sql function to save the merged data to an SQL file.
- Ensure no CSVs are stored:
- Make sure the CSVs are not accidentally stored in the repository. You can achieve this by adding the CSV files to .gitignore or simply not saving them in your project folder.

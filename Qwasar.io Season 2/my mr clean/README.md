## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
- Simple Search Engine for Earth-Related Topics
This project involves building a simple search engine focused on Earth-related topics, utilizing data from a Wikipedia article about the Ozone Layer. The notebook outlines the steps to retrieve, process, and visualize the content of the article, providing a foundational framework for further enhancements.

## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
- The goal of this project is to create a basic search engine that can analyze and visualize the content of a Wikipedia article.
- This can serve as a starting point for more complex search engine functionalities, such as indexing multiple articles or implementing advanced search features.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
- To run this notebook, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: requests, re, collections, matplotlib

## Usage
- How does it work?
- The project is divided into the following steps:

- Retrieve Article Content: Fetch the content of the Wikipedia article using the Wikipedia API.
- Merge Contents: Extract and clean the relevant content from the API response.
- Tokenization: Split the content into individual words.
- Lowercase Conversion: Convert all words to lowercase for uniformity.
- Count Frequency: Count the occurrences of each word.
- Print Most Frequent Words: Display the most common words in the article.
- Visualization: Create a histogram to visualize the frequency of the most common words.
- Remove Stop Words: Filter out common stop words to focus on more meaningful terms.
- Visualize Filtered Frequencies: Visualize the frequency of the most common words after stop words have been removed.

## Task
the task was about the project called MY Vivino: The Objective of the task are:to develop a data-driven wine recommendation system for the company to enhance customer satisfaction and compete with other wines companies; to improved accuracy of wine recommendations compared to the current rules-based system; to receive positive feedback from users on the new recommendation system and to increase in customer engagement and sales.
therefore, in order to achieve that, the below steps are required:
- Data colllection and cleaning 
- Data exporation
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Communication
## Description
the problems are being solve by following step by step. we install all the required libraries and import them into our notebook. we collected our dataset in the form of csv using pandas, expore it and clean it by dropping some columns, replacing some features and removing the missing values. we also used matplotlib to visualize: the percentage distribution, rating the wine consumption by countries, styles, year and price. functions are used led the task descriptions steps. 


## Installation
for the code we use jupyter notebook to run smoothly some installations was made like: numpy, pandas, plotly, seaborn, Scikit-learn, catboost and lightgbm

## Usage
the code is run using 'ipython my_vivino.ipynb' or by calling jupyter notebook on the terminal using 'jupyter notebook --no-browser' then copy the url address to open the notebook, then click on 'my_vivino.ipynb', the run the cells one after another.

# Welcome to My Linear Regression
***

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
- Linear Regression and Gradient Descent Optimization.
- This project implements a simple linear regression model using the least squares method and a gradient descent optimizer. 
- It includes functions for predicting values, calculating mean squared error, and visualizing the results in 2D and 3D plots.


## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
- Linear Regression: Fit a linear model to randomly generated data.
- Mean Squared Error Calculation: Compute the mean squared error between predicted and actual values.
- Gradient Descent Optimization: Optimize a given function using gradient descent and visualize the optimization process in 3D.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
- This code requires the following Python libraries:
- numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing data.

## Usage
- How does it work?
- Linear Regression:
- Generate random data and fit the linear regression model.
- Plot the original data and the fitted line.
- Gradient Descent Optimization:
- Define a function and its gradient.
- Use the GradientDescentOptimizer to find the minimum of the function and visualize the optimization process.
- Running the Code
- To run the code, simply execute the script in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook that has the required dependencies installed. The script will generate plots for the linear regression fit and the gradient descent optimization process.

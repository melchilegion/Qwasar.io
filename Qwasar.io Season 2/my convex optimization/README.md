# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
- # Optimization and Root-Finding Toolkit

- This Python script provides a collection of optimization and root-finding algorithms, along with visualization tools. 
- It demonstrates various numerical methods for finding function minima, roots, and solving linear programming problems.

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
1. Function Optimization
   - Uses SciPy's `minimize_scalar` to find the global minimum of a custom function
   - Implements a gradient descent algorithm for finding local minima

2. Root-Finding Algorithms
   - Bisection method
   - Newton-Raphson method

3. Linear Programming
   - Solves linear programming problems using SciPy's `linprog`

4. Visualization
   - Plots functions and their critical points
   - Provides a customizable function visualization tool

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
- You have to import the dependencies associated 
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- before the code works for you.

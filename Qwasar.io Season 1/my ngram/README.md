# Welcome to My Ngram

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
- I declare an array char_count of size 256 to store the count of each character.
- I assumed ASCII characters only, so we can use an array of size 256.
- I looped through each command-line argument (starting from argv[1]) and iterate through each character in the string using a pointer str.
- For each character, we increment the corresponding count in the char_count array using the character as an index.
- Finally, we loop through the char_count array and print each character and its count if the count is greater than 0. We use the %c format specifier to print the character and %d to print the count.


## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
- I declare an array char_count of size 256 to store the count of each character.
- I assumed ASCII characters only, so we can use an array of size 256.
- I looped through each command-line argument (starting from argv[1]) and iterate through each character in the string using a pointer str.
- For each character, we increment the corresponding count in the char_count array using the character as an index.
- Finally, we loop through the char_count array and print each character and its count if the count is greater than 0. We use the %c format specifier to print the character and %d to print the count.


## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
- To install you just have to send the command 'make' within the terminal
- I declare an array char_count of size 256 to store the count of each character.
- I assumed ASCII characters only, so we can use an array of size 256.
- I looped through each command-line argument (starting from argv[1]) and iterate through each character in the string using a pointer str.
- For each character, we increment the corresponding count in the char_count array using the character as an index.
- Finally, we loop through the char_count array and print each character and its count if the count is greater than 0. We use the %c format specifier to print the character and %d to print the count.



## Usage
- How does it work?
- it works exactly the way i said it would work.
- I declare an array char_count of size 256 to store the count of each character.
- I assumed ASCII characters only, so we can use an array of size 256.
- I looped through each command-line argument (starting from argv[1]) and iterate through each character in the string using a pointer str.
- For each character, we increment the corresponding count in the char_count array using the character as an index.
- Finally, we loop through the char_count array and print each character and its count if the count is greater than 0. We use the %c format specifier to print the character and %d to print the count.

Atari Games AI with Deep Q-Networks

## Task
- What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
- Introduction
This project aims to build an AI that can play Atari video games using reinforcement learning techniques, specifically Deep Q-Networks (DQN). 
The AI will be trained to play three different Atari games: CartPole, Space Invaders, and Pacman. 
The goal is to create an agent that can learn to play these games better than a human player.


## Description
- How have you solved the problem?
- Background
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. 
The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and aims to maximize the cumulative reward over time.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) represent the optimal action-value function as a neural network instead of a table, making it suitable for environments with large state spaces, such as Atari games.

## Installation
- How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
To run this project, you need to set up a Python environment with the required libraries. You can use Google Colab for an easy setup. Follow these steps:
1. Open a new Google Colab notebook.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```python
   !pip install gym[atari] tensorflow keras opencv-python
3. import the necessary libraries:
    import gym
    import numpy as np
    import random
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from collections import deque
    import tensorflow as tf
    from tensorflow import keras
    from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Usage
- How does it work?
This project includes implementations for training DQN agents on three Atari games. The main components of the project are:
- DQNAgent: A class that implements the DQN algorithm, including experience replay and target network updates.
- Training Functions: Functions to train the agent on each game (CartPole, Space Invaders, and Pacman).
- Visualization: A function to plot the scores achieved by the agent during training.
- Training
To train the agents, you can run the following code snippets in your Google Colab notebook:
1. Train CartPole
    cartpole_scores = train_cartpole()
    plot_scores(cartpole_scores, "CartPole Scores")
2. Train Space Invaders
    space_invaders_scores = train_space_invaders()
    plot_scores(space_invaders_scores, "Space Invaders Scores")
3. Train Pacman
    pacman_scores = train_pacman()
    plot_scores(pacman_scores, "Pacman Scores")
- Results
After training, you can visualize the scores achieved by the agent in each game. 
The plots will show how the agent's performance improves over time as it learns from its experiences.
- Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning and DQNs in training an AI to play Atari games. 
The results show that the agent can learn to play the games effectively, and there is potential for further improvements by experimenting with hyperparameters, neural network architectures, and additional training techniques.
In order not to encounter errors i suggest you use Google Colab to run this because it has enough GPU capacity for the agents iterations.
